### Java Dinosaur Zoo
Imagine you are a programmer for a hi-tech dinosaur zoo! Devise a program to manage the dinosaur enclosures, where each dinosaur has its name, species type, and age. Users should be able to insert new dinosaurs, delete dinosaurs when they have been moved, and look up specific dinosaurs. Dinosaurs should be sorted by name, species type, or age.

>**TIPS:**
>- Use Java data structures such as HashMaps or ArrayLists for your zoo.
>- Look up Java's Comparable interface for the sorting part.
>- You could use classes to create objects representing each dinosaur.

### Rocket Route Planner
As an astronomical software developer, your mission is to create a route planner for space rockets. The routes are from Earth to various planets in our solar system. The routes should be stored in a unique way, tagged with the destination planet and estimated travel time. The user should be able to add, remove, and edit routes, and search for routes to specific planets.

>**TIPS:**
>- A good data structure for this could be a HashMap.
>- Remember to handle edge cases like if the planet doesn't exist in your map.
>- Leverage methods for adding, removing, and editing entries in your data structure.

### Retro Game Scoreboard
Create a simple scoring program for a retro arcade. Each game has a unique name and top score. The users can add new games, update the top score when it is beaten, and see a list of games sorted by top score or alphabetically.

>**TIPS:**
>- Use a class for each game with properties for the name and top score.
>- A HashMap or ArrayList could serve as your collection of games.
>- Provide methods to add, update, and retrieve games, while properly handling edge cases.

### The Quantum Cat Challenge
Assume the existence of a trans-dimensional feline explorer, named "Quantum Cat", in a computer simulation. In this environment, a 2D grid represents different "dimensions", and Quantum Cat can exist in multiple dimensions at once. However, it can only exist in a maximum of two different dimensions per instant. Write a Java method that takes in two parameters: a starting coordinate (x0, y0) and an ending coordinate (x1, y1). The method should calculate and return the minimum amount of "jumps" Quantum Cat needs to make to get from the starting to the ending coordinate, considering it can jump to any other coordinate in the grid, but only if this coordinate has the same x or y of his current coordinates. It can also move to the adjacent cell in any direction. Refrain from using libraries for this task and stick to the java.util package.
```java
public static int calculateJumps(int[] start, int[] end) {
    // Implement your logic to calculate the minimum jumps Quantum Cat needs
    // to make from the starting coordinate to the ending coordinate
    
    // Placeholder return value, replace it with your actual logic
    return 0;
}
```

### The Procedural Celestial Body Tour Generator
Write a Java program that simulates a procedural celestial body tour generator. Your program should generate a random sequence of planets and moons to visit in a specific order, each characterized by a name, type (planet or moon), and distance from Earth in light years. Your system will consider the shortest travel routes and time it takes to travel given the speed of light. Also, incorporate the fact that traveling to more planets increases the risk of any given tour. Your program should take an upper limit for the level of risk of the tour as an input (a value between 0 and 1), and ensure that the generated tour does not exceed this level of risk. Risk of visiting each celestial body is a random value between 0 and 0.1.

### The Mythical Game Matcher
You've been asked to write a Java program for a gaming company. The program has to match players in a new multiplayer fantasy game. Each character has an in-game "power level" calculated based on their in-game accomplishments and gear. Your program should pair up players for a match based on their current in-game power levels, it should always strive to pair players of similar power levels together. Write a simulation of the matchmaking system, where each game character has a name and a power level (0-100). The output should be a list of matches, and each match should contain two characters with the closest possible power levels. If there's an odd number of players, the player who is left without a match should be marked as waiting for the next round.
